DESCRIPTION:
The project consists on a web page similar to Wikamp (a moodle platform for university).

HOW IT WORKS:
In the log-in page you can enter any log in and any password (if you don't write anything in one of the inputs it will say that log in or password is incorrect).
At left side there is a menu that allows you to navigate on the web easily. If you click on a subject (of your courses or of enrolling courses) it will show you a page with a brief
descrption, documents and grades of the subject.
